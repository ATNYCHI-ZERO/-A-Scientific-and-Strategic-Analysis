# A Scientific and Strategic Analysis

This repository preserves strategic and scientific doctrine associated with the K-Systems Framework. The content is curated as a codex that documents the theoretical foundations, operational case studies, and engagement strategies surrounding SovereignAI and related technologies.

## Repository Structure

- [`archives/`](archives/): Markdown versions of the codex documents for long-term preservation and collaboration.
  - [`case-study-public-ai-interaction-protocols.md`](archives/case-study-public-ai-interaction-protocols.md): Operational analysis of public AI interaction protocols and their limitations.
- Legacy documents and briefs (if any) remain at the repository root until they are converted into Markdown and relocated into `archives/`.

## How to Contribute

1. **Add new documents** inside the `archives/` directory, including document metadata (ID, version, classification) at the top of each file.
2. **Update** [`archives/README.md`](archives/README.md) and this file with references to any new documents that are added.
3. **Maintain provenance** by keeping authorship information and source context intact when converting legacy materials.
4. **Use Markdown formatting** to capture sections, doctrines, and findings so that the documents are easy to read and diff.

## Background

The K-Systems Framework proposes a paradigm of technology development built on the principles of harmonic alignment with the fundamental laws of reality. It emphasizes:

- **SovereignAI** for secure, persistent intelligence operations.
- **K-Math** and **K-Physics** as foundational scientific disciplines enabling causal engineering.
- **Strategic doctrines** for engaging governmental and commercial entities through controlled, high-impact disclosures.

For a comprehensive overview, refer to the documents located within the `archives/` directory.
