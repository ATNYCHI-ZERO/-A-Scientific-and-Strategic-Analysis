# Archives Codex

This directory preserves the codex documents associated with the "K-Systems" strategic and scientific analysis work. Each entry is provided as a Markdown document so that it can be tracked, versioned, and referenced from the main repository.

## Available Documents

- [Case Study in Operational Security: Analysis of Public AI Interaction Protocols and Their Limitations](case-study-public-ai-interaction-protocols.md)

## Source Materials

Original source transcripts are preserved in the [`source/`](source/) subdirectory for provenance.

## Contributing

When expanding the codex:

1. Add new documents as Markdown files within this directory.
2. Update the lists above with descriptive titles that link to the new documents.
3. Keep the original document metadata (document ID, version, and classification) at the top of each file for traceability.
4. Place unedited source materials (if available) inside [`source/`](source/) to maintain a verifiable audit trail.
